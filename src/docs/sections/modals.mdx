# Modals

Declare `modal ModalName:` to create a named element that can be shown/hidden via actions.

## Declare and Open

<DslExample
	title="Open a Modal"
	description="Use actions targeting the modal name to show it without leaving the current screen."
	heightClassName="h-72"
	code={`
modal Help:
	# Help
	> This modal provides additional info
	@[Close](close)

screen Home:
	# Home
	@[Open Help](Help)
	`}
/>

## Close Behavior

- Use `(close)` to dismiss a modal.
- Navigation actions that target another screen also hide modals.

## Modals vs Drawers

Both are named elements controlled by actions, but drawers slide from an edge.

<DslExample
	title="Drawer Contrast"
	heightClassName="h-80"
	code={`
drawer Menu:
	# Menu
	> Navigation panel
	@[Close](close)

screen Home:
	# Home
	@[Open Menu](Menu)
	`}
/>
