# Navigation

Use actions to switch screens or activate named elements.

## Screen to Screen

<DslExample
	title="Navigate Between Screens"
	heightClassName="h-72"
	code={`
screen Home:
	# Home
	@[Go to About](About)

screen About:
	# About
	@[Back to Home](Home)
	`}
/>

## Activate Named Elements

<DslExample
	title="Open a Modal via Action"
	heightClassName="h-72"
	code={`
modal Info:
	# Info
	> Details here
	@[Close](close)

screen Home:
	# Home
	@[Open Info](Info)
	`}
/>

Tips:

- The first declared `screen` is the initial view.
- `(Destination)` switches to a screen named `Destination` if it exists.
- If `Destination` matches a named element (modal/drawer), it is activated instead of navigating.
