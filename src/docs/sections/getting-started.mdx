# Getting Started

import { DslExample } from "../../components/docs";

Welcome to proto-typed â€” a React-based prototyping tool with a custom DSL. Use the editor on the left and the live preview on the right to iterate fast.

## Core Concepts
- Screens: top-level views declared with `screen Name:`
- Components: reusable blocks declared with `component Name:` and used via `$Name`
- Named Elements: `modal Name:` and `drawer Name:` managed by navigation
- Layout: `container`, `row`, `col`, `grid`, `card`
- Interactivity: `@[Button]()` and `#[Link]()` plus images `![alt](src)`

## First Screen
<DslExample title="Two screens and navigation" description="Define screens and navigate with button actions.">

```dsl
screen Home:
  # Heading 1
  > Welcome to proto-typed
  @[Open Details](Details)

screen Details:
  > Back to home
  @[Go Home](Home)
```

</DslExample>

## Reusable Component
<DslExample title="Declare and use a component" description="Create a component once, reuse anywhere.">

```dsl
component Hero:
  # Hello
  > This content is reusable
  @[Action]()

screen UsesHero:
  $Hero
```

</DslExample>

Tips:
- Indent children under containers with two spaces.
- Optional pieces use `?` suffix, e.g., `@[Button]?()`.
- Keep the app running with `npm run dev` to see changes instantly.
