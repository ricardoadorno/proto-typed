# Screens

Screens are top-level views in your prototype. Declare them with `screen Name:` and indent child elements beneath.

## Declaration

<DslExample
  title="Declare Screens"
  description="Define multiple screens and navigate between them using button/link actions."
  heightClassName="h-72"
  code={`
screen Home:
  # Welcome
  > Build fast with the DSL
  @[Go to About](About)

screen About:
  # About Page
  > This is a separate screen
  @[Back](Home)
  `}
/>

## Behavior

- The first declared `screen` is the initial screen shown in the preview.
- Navigation is internal: actions like `@[Go](Target)` switch to the `screen Target` if it exists.
- If an action points to a named element (`modal`, `drawer`), that element is activated instead of switching screens.

## Named Element Activation

<DslExample
  title="Open a Modal from a Screen"
  description="Actions can target named UI elements. When they do, the element is shown without changing screens."
  heightClassName="h-72"
  code={`
modal Info:
  # Info
  > Details here
  @[Close](close)

screen Home:
  # Home
  @[Open Info](Info)
  `}
/>

## Composition

Screens can include components and layout containers:

<DslExample
  title="Components and Layouts"
  description="Reuse components inside screens and compose layouts with containers like grid and card."
  heightClassName="h-80"
  code={`
component Header:
  header:
    # My App

screen Dashboard:
  $Header
  grid:
    card:
      ### Metric
      > 123
  `}
/>

## Tips

- Keep screen names concise and unique.
- Prefer components for repeated structures (headers, footers, nav).
- Use containers (`grid:`, `flex:`, `section:`, `card:`) for layout within a screen.
- Target named elements (e.g., `Info` modal) to enhance flows without leaving the current screen.
