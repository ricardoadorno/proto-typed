# Components

Declare reusable blocks with `component Name:` and instantiate with `$Name`.

## Declare and Use

<DslExample
	title="Component Declaration and Usage"
	heightClassName="h-72"
	code={`
component Header:
	header:
		# My App

screen Home:
	$Header
	> Welcome to the app
	@[About](About)

screen About:
	$Header
	> About page content
	@[Back](Home)
	`}
/>

Tips:

- Keep components focused (headers, footers, cards).
- Pass content via composition where needed (nest underneath after instantiation).
- Combine with layout primitives for structure.
