# Components Overview

import { DslExample } from "../../components/docs";

Components let you define reusable UI fragments once and reference them anywhere with `$Name`.

## Declare a Component
<DslExample title="Define a component">

```dsl
component Callout:
  card:
    # Title
    > Supporting text
    @+[Learn more]

screen Library:
  $Callout
  $Callout
```

</DslExample>


## Composition
Components can include layout and interactive elements, and they can be combined with local content.
<DslExample title="Compose components">

```dsl
component Toolbar:
  row:
    @[Save]() @_[Cancel]()

screen Editor:
  $Toolbar
  container:
    > Editor body
```

</DslExample>

Guidelines:
- Keep components focused and small.
- Prefer composition over deep nesting for performance.
