# Navigation & Overlays

import { DslExample } from "../../components/docs";

Modals and drawers are named elements that toggle visibility via navigation actions.

## Declare Overlays
<DslExample title="Declare overlays">

```dsl
modal Help:
  # Need Help?
  > Helpful information here
  @[Close]()

drawer SideNav:
  > Links and quick actions
  #[Home](Home)
```

</DslExample>

## Activate Overlays
<DslExample title="Activate overlays" heightClassName="h-28">

```dsl
@[Show Help](Help)
@[Open Menu](SideNav)
```

</DslExample>

Notes:
- Overlays are hidden by default and shown when referenced by name.
- They can be placed alongside `screen` declarations or within components.
